## 30 Days of Python

Welcome to my 30 Days of Python journey! This repository is my daily log of Python programming concepts, challenges, and projects. Each day, I explore a new topic to deepen my understanding of Python and its applications.

## Overview

The 30 Days of Python challenge is designed to:

Build a strong foundation in Python programming.

Explore advanced topics like web scraping, APIs, and data analysis.

Practice consistency and apply Python to real-world scenarios.

ðŸ“… Topics and Progress


01	Introduction: Overview of Python, installation, and setting up the environment.

02	Variables: Built-in Functions	Explored variables, data types, and Python's built-in functions.

03	Operators: Learned about arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators.

04	Strings: Worked with string methods, formatting, and manipulation.

05	Lists:	Learned list operations, slicing, and iteration.

06	Tuples: Explored tuples, immutability, and use cases.

07	Sets:	Learned about set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

08	Dictionaries:	Practiced with key-value pairs and nested dictionaries.

09	Conditionals:	Worked with if, elif, else, and logical conditions.

10	Loops:	Practiced for and while loops, and iterating through collections.

11	Functions:	Defined functions, used arguments, and explored scope and return values.
